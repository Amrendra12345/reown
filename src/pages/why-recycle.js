					<h1> Why Recycle ? </h1>
				</div>
                <p className="mt-1">Recycling is very important as waste has a huge negative impact on the natural environment. Harmful chemicals and greenhouse gasses are released from rubbish in landfill sites. Recycling helps to reduce the pollution caused by waste. The amount of rubbish we create is constantly increasing because people are buying more products and ultimately creating more waste. New technological products are being developed, much of these products contain materials that are not biodegradable. Recycling is one of the best ways to create a positive impact on the world in which we live. Recycle Device through its parent company Exigo Recycling Pvt. Ltd. has started an initiative to remove complexity out of the process of recycling of electronic devices while creating awareness for the need to recycle E waste in an environment-friendly way for a greener, safer planet for the generations to come. Our aim is to provide a simple, straightforward, transparent and sustainable way to recycle your e-waste and electronic assets by directly connecting to you. Exigo is authorized by the State Pollution Boards & Govt. of India to safely Collect, Transport, Dismantle, Segregate & Dispose E waste. Exigo is also registered as a Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO) to fulfil all the statutory compliances for producers under Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR).</p>
